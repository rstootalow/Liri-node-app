## NPM Packages

#### [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): This package was installed to be able to leverage various APIs by making http requests directly from Node.js. <br> 

<code>npm install axios</code>

#### [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): This package was used to store variables of api keys and passwords that I would like to keep private as I publish my project on GitHub pages, while still having access to the APIs I used in this project. <br> 

<code>npm install dotenv</code>

#### [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment): This package was used to convert dates and times from Axios responses in to more readable formats. <br>
